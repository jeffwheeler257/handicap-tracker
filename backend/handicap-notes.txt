Course Rating - what a scratch golfer shoots on average at that course
Slope Rating - difference between a bogey, average and scratch golfer times some constant (between 55 - 155, standard is 113)
Adjusted gross score - score after 18, or score after 9 times 2

Calculating score differentials:
Score Differential = ((Adjusted Gross Score - Course Rating) x 113) / Slope Rating (rounded to one decimal place)
